# Security Best Practices

## 1. API Authentication

- Use API keys (C++) or JWT (Java) for all client-server communications.
- Rotate API keys and JWT tokens regularly.

## 2. Data Encryption

- Use TLS to encrypt data in transit between nodes.
- Enable encryption for data at rest using `DataEncryption.cpp`.

## 3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Implement role-based access control for sensitive operations.
- Use RBAC (Python) to define different user roles and privileges.

## 4. Firewall Protection

- Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) using `WAFConfig.py` to protect against common threats like SQL injection and XSS.

## 5. Regular Security Audits

- Perform regular penetration testing using `PenetrationTests.py`.
- Use automated tools to scan for vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies.
