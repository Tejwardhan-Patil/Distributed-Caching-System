# Distributed Caching System Architecture

## Overview

The Distributed Caching System is designed to store and manage cache data efficiently across multiple nodes in a distributed environment. It supports several storage backends, consistency models, and replication strategies to ensure scalability, fault tolerance, and high availability.

## Components

### 1. Cache Storage

The cache storage layer supports in-memory and persistent storage backends, implemented in multiple languages:

- **InMemoryStore**: Core in-memory cache implementation (C++).
- **Eviction Policies**:
  - LRU (Java)
  - LFU (Java)
  - FIFO (C++)
- **Persistent Cache**:
  - Disk-based storage (Python)
  - SSD-based storage (C++)

### 2. Distributed Architecture

The system employs consistent hashing, range partitioning, and multiple replication strategies for data partitioning and replication across nodes:

- **Partitioning**: Consistent hashing (Java) and Range partitioning (C++).
- **Replication**: Multi-master (Python) and master-slave (C++) strategies.
- **Sharding**: Managed by the ShardManager (Java).

### 3. Consistency Management

Supports multiple consistency models, including:

- Eventual Consistency (Java)
- Strong Consistency (C++)
- Quorum-based Consistency (Python)

### 4. Cache Coordination

Distributed coordination mechanisms include:

- **Leader Election**: Raft (Java) and Paxos (C++).
- **Membership Management**: Gossip Protocol (Python) and Membership Service (Java).

### 5. Networking

For inter-node communication, the system uses:

- **RPC**: Server (Java) and Client (C++) implementations.
- **Protocols**: gRPC (Python) and Thrift (Java).

### 6. Management and APIs

APIs and tools for managing the cache system:

- **Cache API**: Main API (Python, Flask/FastAPI) and routes (Java).
- **Admin Console**: Web console for managing nodes and metrics (C++).
- **CLI Tool**: Command-line tool for cache operations (Python).

### 7. Security

Security features include:

- API key (C++) and JWT-based (Java) authentication.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) (Python).
- TLS encryption (Java) and Web Application Firewall (Python).

### 8. Fault Tolerance and Recovery

Fault tolerance mechanisms:

- Failover strategies (Java).
- Data recovery through logs (C++) and snapshots (Python).

### 9. Monitoring and Logging

Integrated monitoring with Prometheus (Python) and alerting rules in YAML.

## Data Flow

Data flows through the cache storage, partitioning, replication, and consistency management layers before reaching the clients via APIs or direct CLI commands.
